At present the libraries are Google Maps, Open Street Map, jQuery DataTables and FontAwesome. When loading resources over a network, the 3rd party server will receive your IP address and User Agent string amongst other details. Please refer to the Privacy Policy of the respective libraries for details on how they use data and the process to exercise your rights under the GDPR regulations.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWP Go Maps uses jQuery DataTables to display sortable, searchable tables, such as that seen in the Advanced Marker Listing and on the Map Edit Page. jQuery DataTables in certain circumstances uses a cookie to save and later recall the \"state\" of a given table - that is, the search term, sort column and order and current page. This data is held in local storage and retained until this is cleared manually. No libraries used by WP Go Maps transmit this information.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPlease <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/maps\/terms\">see here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/help\/terms_maps.html\">here<\/a> for Google's terms.
