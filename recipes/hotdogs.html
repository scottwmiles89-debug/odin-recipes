    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These marinated grilled hot dogs are so flavorful, you may never cook them any other way again. A 2-ingredient marinade and overnight are all you need.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>16 hot dogs</li>
<li>1 cup Italian dressing</li>
<li>3 tablespoons steak marinade</li>
<li>16 hot dog buns and desired toppings, for serving</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use a sharp knife to make shallow diagonal cuts across each hot dog, about 1/8- to 1/4-inch deep and 3/4-inch apart.</li>
<li>Place the scored hot dogs in a large resealable plastic bag and add dressing and marinade.</li>
<li>Seal bag tightly, and turn to coat evenly. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight for best flavor, flipping the bag occasionally.</li>
<li>Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.</li>
<li>Remove the hot dogs from the marinade, letting excess drip off, and grill for 5 to 7 minutes, turning occasionally, until heated through and lightly charred. Serve warm, in buns with desired toppings.</li>
</ol>
